                                 Linear Regression

linear regression is one of those algorithm which is easy to understand
linear regression is a supervised machine-learning algorithm
supervised means labeled data given 
linear regression has 3 types 
1. simple linear regression
2. multiple linear regression
3 polynomial linear regression

simple linear regression in which we have one input column and one output column
for example we have data of the 4rth year students that has done their placement 
data will be in 2 columns 
one what will be the cgpa and other will be what will be the package 
than if we see we have only 2 column 
cgpa is input and package is output
anyone tell you cgpa you have to tell what will be the package
simple linear regression will work when data is linear

y=mx+b
y is package
x is cgpa
m and b is start of linear package
